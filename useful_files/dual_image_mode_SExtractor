1. for F814W 

 

0. PREREQUISITE: ESO_dual_F814WxF814W.conf, ESO_dual.param, gauss_3.0_7x7.conv

 

FILTER	MAG_ZEROPOINT	EXP TIME
F814W	25.984 [http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/analysis/zeropoints]	678.000 
F475W	26.059 	1728.000 
F275W	24.169[http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/analysis/uvis_zpts/uvis1_infinite]	3030.000 
F160W 	25.9463 [http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/analysis/ir_phot_zpt]	798.466 
 

  #Calculate Zeropoints

  stMagZPt = -2.5*np.log10(photFlam) - 21.1

  abMagZpt = -2.5*np.log10(photFlam) - 21.1 - 5*np.log10(photPlam) + 18.692
 

1. PATH to directory: ~/Documents/TestSextractor/sunilSExtractor/F814W

2. DETECT_THRESH: 6.5 #default was 1.5 but modified inorder to minimize the pixel stack overflow warning (also can be minimized by editing the memory values in memory section of .conf file

3. CATALOG_NAME: ESO_F814WxF814W.cat #output file created

4. GAIN: 678.0 #exposure time. Two ways to find exp.time

 

method1. 

go to MAST HST url and search the target, after you are in HST Search Results, look up in the (xrow, ycolumn)=(F814W,Exp Time) which is 678.00 s 

 

method2.

open two *flc.fits in DS9, open the header(but not the [SCI])- in the section EXPOSURE INFORMATION, look up for EXPTIME, since you have two flc files you need to add to get total exposure time. 

 

5. MAG_ZEROPOINT: to get the AB_ZERO_POINT magnitude 

EITHER go to MAST HST url and search the target, after you are in HST Search Results, look up in the (xrow,ycol) =(F814W, Start Time) to get the date 

 

OR open ds9 *flc.FITS  and open the header [SCI] - in the section EXPOSURE INFORMATION, look for DATE-OBS, as you will need later to find the magnitude

 

Now open HST ACS ZEROPOINTS AND FLUX CALIBRATION in the url[http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/analysis/zeropoints], click the zeropoints which is on the right side. now look up for the ZEROPOINT CALCULATOR, [https://acszeropoints.stsci.edu/]

 

In the calculator, type date [2011-07-17] and choose the option[i.e. WFC], you will see your required mag  25.984 in the last column[i.e. ABmag]

 

FOR WFC3/UVIS	#which mag is correct i.e. UVIS1 OR UVIS2

go to http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/analysis/uvis_zpts/uvis1_infinite

from the UVIS1 Photometry Tables, get the ABmag of F275W 

Alternately, you can use PHOTPLAM, PHOTFLAM -values to calculate ABmag

>> from astroptical.photometry import zeropoint

>> zeropoint(4,5)  

>> zeropoint(PHOTFLAM, PHOTPLAM)

 

FOR WFC3/IR

go to http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/analysis/ir_phot_zpt

 

 

6. WEIGHT_IMAGE: get < name_rms.fits > file called weight image.  for more information see /Information/AstrOptical_CR_SEx_FitsUt #having chip-gap in wt. im. is ok.

 

7. WEIGHT_GAIN : N,N #but in ur code it is only N

 

8. PHOT_APERTURES: ?? #how to define aperture sizes

 

DETECT_THRESH: 6.5 #default 1.5

Objects: detected 7393     / sextracted 7047  

 

 

2. For F475W

DETECT_THRESH: 5.0 #default 1.5

Objects: detected 7391     / sextracted 6956  

 

3. For F275W

DETECT_THRESH           1.5

 Objects: detected 2988     / sextracted 2797 

 

4. For F160W
