FITS Data Manipulations

       add comment records to FITS header
  addhist
       adds history records to FITS header
  chimtype
       change data type (e.g. real->integer) in an image. Data may be optionally rescaled.
  copyheader
       copy header keywords from one FITS file to another (see also FTOOL cphead).
  copywcs
       copy just the World Coordinate System keywords from the header of one FITS image to others.
  fcolappend
       append a constant column to a FITS table
  fitsparsename
       Prints components of the extended FITS file name.

       prints out the total exposure of the GTI file
  gtifits
       converts ASCII GTI files to FITS format
  iffits
       prints 1 if its argument is a fits file, 0 otherwise
  listfits
       print out FITS header keywords. See also listhead supplied with FITSIO.
  modifyheader
       modifies FITS header. This tools is derived from FTOOL fmodhead but incorporates two important improvements

       prints a FITS keyword value
  rfits
       convert fits image to unformatted fortran file

  list2img
       convert ASCII `photon list' to an image
  makeimg
